## Synopsis

A shitty discord bot I made for my own server with some friends. This is a really bare bones version of the bot I use becuase I figured most of the stuff I am using on my is not something most people need. I will eventually add the features I use in a useful way but not in the near future.

## Usage

All you need to do is put your discord app unique ID in the "YOUR_KEY" field and your username in the "YOUR_NAME#420" Field. I will make an easier way to have usergroups have access to the commands at some point but the discordpy api isn't that hard to read if you want to take it upon yourself.
